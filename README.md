# Head-Gear

## Brief:
Head Gear is a state-of-the-art smart helmet designed to enhance rider safety and prevent road accidents. It incorporates advanced features such as accident prevention, over speed detection, alcohol detection, ignition locking mechanism, and visual and voice-enabled warnings for approaching intersections and pedestrian crossings. Additionally, it offers a heads-up display (HUD) and utilizes bone conduction earphones for interactive navigation assistance and warnings.

## Features:
